# Analog_Clock
The Analog Clock project is a web-based application that presents a classic analog clock on a web page. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive clock. What sets this clock apart is the integration of a clock image, which enhances its visual appeal and closely resembles a traditional analog timepiece.
